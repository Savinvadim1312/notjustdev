### 4. Handy Helper

On demand Home Service Booking

"When looking to book for handyman services, we always find few websites and look into their services to see if we can find the service(s) we need. And to book for the services, we have to call the company and book via telephone. And once, they are done with their job, we pay for the services in-person. This process seems daunting especially when you need to book for different services but needs to browse through various websites until you can find one that offers all the service you needed and at the same time, provides fast services. Now coming to our project, we wanted to build a Application as well as Website where user can find almost all the services that are needed, and at the same time, they can book and pay for their services online within few clicks. Thus, combining all the different process into one."
