### 🔴 Demo day

📅 Monday 28th November - [3pm UTC](https://dateful.com/convert/utc?t=3pm)

## Demo day

To participate at the demo day, you will have to submit a 3 minutes long video presentation of your project together with a link to the github repository. The submissions that follow the requirements will be played at the Demo Day, on 28th November, and our juries will vote for the best ones.

For the video presentation, we recommend following this structure:

- Introduce yourself and the project in one sentence
- Talk about the problem. Why is there a need for your application. It can also be for your personal need, that’s fine as long as there is a purpose behind.
- Talk about the solution.
  How are you planning to solve this problem. Here, you have the opportunity to show your vision for the project. You defiently won’t manage to build everything in just 3 days, but it’s important to visualise how the solution will look in the end.
- What technologies did you use?
- Demo. Show us the main functionalities of your application. Even if not everything is perfect.
- What are your next steps? Do you plan on continuing to work on the app?

❗ The video should be maximum 3 minutes. In order to give everyone the possibility to present, we will stop the video presentations at 3 minutes.

## 🧑‍⚖️ Evaluation criteria

All projects will be judged by our juries.

The criteria will be:

- **The idea**
  The usefulness of the project in real-world
- **UI/UX**
  Keep it simple and consistent. There is not enough time to invest in sophisticated UIs and animations. The focus should be on simplicity, usability, and overall look of the application.
- **Realisation**
  The completeness and complexity of your project will be evaluated here. We recommend focusing on having the most critical features “workable” first.
- **Presentation**
  Your presentation skills

Requirements:

- The project should be a **Mobile Application** build with any tools/technologies/frameworks you know best
- **The project should be started during the Hackathon**
- You can work alone, or in teams

Hoping to see more of these events in the future, in uncertain times like this you are truly helping out a lot of people and fostering talents. I truly believe that NotJustDev is going to be not just a youtube channel but a huge incubator that pushes the boundary of what's possible in the world of startups.](./testimonial3.png)
