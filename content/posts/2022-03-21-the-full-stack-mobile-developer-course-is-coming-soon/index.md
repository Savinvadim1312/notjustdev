Hey notJust Developers ðŸ‘‹

I am so excited to announce that we are very close to opening the doors for the a new batch ðŸŽ‰ **#Batch1**

I've been working full-time for the last 8 months on this course.

I've realised that creating a good course, that will actually help you get closer to your goals as a full-stack mobile developer, is very hard. It requires a lot of planning when it comes to the structure of the course, keeping in mind the end product that you will build.

I made sure to cover a very wide set of skills that would help you with the whole process of developing a mobile application starting from building a complex Frontend UI, designing and building the backend infrastructure up to deploying your application to production to Play Market and Appstore.

## What will you learn

We have 7 core modules ready, and now I am working on the next 2.

### 1. Intro

Get started and onboard on our educational platform and the private community.

### 2. Project Setup

Setup your system and the new project with all the tools that we will need.

### 3. UI

Build the complex UI of the Instagram app and learn how to work and style the primary RN elements like Images, Text, Views, FlatList. As well learn how to structure your project with scalability and maintainability in mind.

### 4. Navigation

Use [React Navigation V6](https://reactnavigation.org/) to setup the navigation in our app. We cover Stack Navigators, Bottom Tab Navigators, Top Tab Bar Navigators and much more.

### 5. Getting started with AWS Amplify

Get an overview of AWS and AWS Amplify and then setup your AWS account from scratch. You will also secure your account and setup Billing alarms for no unexpected bills. The next step is to setup the cli, initialise the project using Amplify Studio UI and connect our project with the backend.

### 6. Authentication

Add an authentication layer to your app using Amazon Cognito. Let users sign up with their email or with his social providers (Facebook, Google). In this module we cover both working with the out-of-the-box authentication flow, as well as building our own UI and connecting it with the Auth API for all the flows: sign up, sign in, confirm account, forgot and reset password.

### 7. API

A lot of creators will just launch this module as an individual course. It is _soooo_ packed with value and it covers a wide variety of features. We start with learning about **GraphQL** and how does **AppSync** work. Then we learn how to design the data model of our application and all the relationships between them, after which we build it with Amplify. We then implement all the **CRUD operations** for all the models (users, posts, comments, likes, etc.). For the graphQL querying library, we will learn how to use **Apollo Client** to interact with our GraphQL API and also to cache all the data for better performance.

### 8. Storage (In progress...)

Implement the storage layer for our images and videos, and link it to our database models.

### 9. Production (In progress...)

Prepare the app for production. This will include preparing all the marketing assets, the production environment on Amplify, building your application, setting them up on both stores (AppStore and Play Market) and automatically deploying the app there.

### And there is more coming

More modules that will cover advanced topics like Following System, Notification System and other important topics are already on our whiteboard.

The good thing is that you will have access to them when they are ready for no additional costs.

## It wouldn't have been possible without #Batch0

Back in August 2021, **201 people** ðŸ¤¯ saw the value of the course I was planning back then, and trusted me enough to join the course as an early student. I am very thankful to all of them because....

The Batch0 members were crucial in shaping this course. They gave me constructive feedback and suggestions that helped me improve the course and bring it to the next level.

Don't take my word for it, see what Chris Warren has to say:

## Vadim, WHEN?

Ok, ok, I also can't wait ðŸ¤©

The launch date is..... \*ba dum tsss\*:

### 24th April ðŸŽ‰

I will come with more details in the following weeks.

Stay tuned, and sign up for the [wait list](https://academy.notjust.dev/), if you are not already there. People on the wait list will get a good offer.
