The #notJustStartup Challenge approached the final phase.

During the last 7 weeks, I challenged the #notJust Development community to build their dream startups. Projects that they always wanted to build, but never found time for it. We all have these ideas in the back of our head of projects and apps we want to build, but for some reason we never end up starting them.

Not until now!

I am so excited to introduce you all the 17 startups that were started in the past 7 weeks.
