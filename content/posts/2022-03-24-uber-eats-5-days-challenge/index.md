Hey notJust Developers ðŸ‘‹

I am so excited to announce our first **Intensive 5 DAYS coding challenge!** ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

We have started preparing this challenge 6 months ago, and we made sure it's packed with value.

By the end of the 5 Days challenge, you will walk away more confident in your skills of building complex, full-stack, end-to-end projects.

## What will we build?

We will build not 1, not 2, but 3 React Native applications and we will connect them together using one common backend.
