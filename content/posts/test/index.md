title: How I developed an App (from 0 to market) in a 12H Livestream

description: "From the time I started doing youtube, I had this idea in mind to
  do a 12H Livestream and to build something. It was inspired by the extreme
  challenges of Mr. Beast's. However, I always procrastinated doing it because I
  was kinda scared (12 hours coding with no break??ðŸ˜±), but when I saw the
  #AmplifyHashnode hackathon organized by Hashnode and Amplify, I knew this is
  the time for it. Also, I kinda missed the hackathon's atmosphere, where we
  used to build working prototypes in 48h with 4 hours of sleep (and lots of
  coffee)"
